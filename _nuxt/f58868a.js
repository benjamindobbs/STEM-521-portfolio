This project does not require any software, and designs could easily be rendered on graph paper or simply done in real time. I would steer students away from overlycomplex patterns for this project so that they don't get frustrated when they need to start doing the math. I used my illustrator file to lasercut cardboard to the exact shape I needed. This could be done with a box cuttuer, or scissors for a more low-tech approach.
