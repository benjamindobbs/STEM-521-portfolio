I designed my mask using Blender, and artist 3D modeling software. After I completed my render I took the file into Mastercam and began working on toolpaths to cut my design from sign foam. I ended up with a nearly complete mask straight off the router. I took some time to add some additional details with a set of jeweler's files. I rounded over sharp edges, added additional surface imperfections and cleaned up a few of the more pitted sections from the router. Once I was happy with the form, I began painting. I employed a few prop making techniques to get my desired aesthetic. I started with a basecoat of a blue tinted silver to get a base polished steel look. I then mixed a dark mudded color and filled in all of the cracks with a fine brush. I then took a shop rag and rubbed in the color. This technique gives the a muddied look. The rag keeps more of the soil tones in the cracks while simultaneously staining the entire piece. After the muddying proccess I went back over the whole mask with a silver wash using a similar rag technique. This returned that metalic surface finish I was looking for.  \n      ")]),e._v(" "),t(d.a,e._l(e.processimages,(function(e,i){return t(l.a,{key:i},[t(m.a,{attrs:{src:e.src,contain:"",height:"100vh",width:"100%"}})],1)})),1)],1),e._v(" "),t(n.a,{staticClass:"ma-6"},[t(c.c,[e._v("\n        Results  \n      ")]),e._v(" "),t(c.b,[e._v("\n          My mask ended up being a different texture from my original render.
